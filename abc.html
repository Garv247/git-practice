	<p>Nice little clouds playing around in the sky. Let all these little things happen. Don't fight them. Learn to use them. You can create beautiful things - but you have to see them in your mind first.In your world you have total and absolute power. Let's get wild today. If you overwork it you become a cloud killer. There's nothing worse than a cloud killer. You need the dark in order to show the light.</p>
